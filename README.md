### Adding New Competition Results

To include new competition results in the project:

1. Add a new `.json` file containing the competition results to the `./assets/results` directory.
   - Make sure the filename matches the competition year (e.g., `2024.json`).
2. Update the `years.json` file:
   - Add the year of the new competition to the `years` array in `years.json`.

By following these steps, the project will automatically recognize and display the new competition results.
